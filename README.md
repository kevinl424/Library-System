## General Info
This is a comprehensive library catalog and checkout system that allows for the creation of new accounts, multiple clients having access at the same time, and servers handling multiple clients. The system was built using Java, JavaFX, and MongoDB, and is hosted on AWS. It incorporates socket networking and multithreading to facilitate seamless communication between clients and prevent checkout overlap. Security features such as email verification, password salting/hashing, and a hold system were also implemented, with permanent data storage ensured using MongoDB.
